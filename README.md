# Data-Science_Computer-Vision

This repository is a collection of workshops and practical applications covering various techniques and theories learned during my university studies in Data Science with a Computer Vision specialization. It tackles the fundamentals of computer vision, including topics such as image invariants, 3D object representation, and more.


This repository serves as a hands-on companion to my studies, providing code examples, exercises, and projects to deepen understanding of core computer vision concepts.
